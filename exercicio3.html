                <p class="information">
                    On Rankeillor Street in Edinburgh, Scotland, Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley lay in bed, talking about future plans after college. Emma asks Dexter where he thinks he'll be when he's forty, and Dexter replies that he hopes he is rich or famous -or both. Emma, a native of Yorkshire, thinks that being famous sounds morbid. Emma wants to change the world somehow. Emma dreams aloud about the future, about Dexter having had three divorces and no children. But Dexter wants an uncomplicated life of success, and he is worried that the one-night stand with Emma will have bad repercussions. Though they have known each other for four years, they really don't know too much about each other. In fact, Dexter has believed Emma's name to be "Anna" until that evening.
                    Emma is working for Sledgehammer Theater Cooperative on the play "Cruel...

                <p class="information">
                    Emma begins writing another novel, a feminist crime story. Ian is very supportive of Emma and everything she does, while Emma has little faith in herself. Emma, likewise, has little faith in what she is doing with Ian. She realizes she is trying to build a life with a man whom she does not love. Dexter, meanwhile, is suffering from melancholy, and tries to mix music like a DJ to heal the depression, but it does not work. Dexter is toying with the idea of becoming an actor, or beginning his own production company. Emma also wonders why she is still friends with Dexter, and wonders why she doesn't let the friendship just die out. Nevertheless, she goes to dinner with him. Dexter is a little bitter despite all of his successes. Dexter is also slightly condescending with Emma's position as...

                    Emma and Dexter are now engaged. Emma is proud of Dexter, and proud to have him meet her family. They holiday at a cottage in North Yorkshire, where Dexter begins working on his wedding vows.

                    Dexter realizes he is slowly getting old, between more hair on his face and gray hairs on his head. He is also gaining some weight. He and Emma are trying to have a baby. They also take opposing points of view on the Iraq War. Emma is to the left politically, while Dexter is to the right. Dexter is also much more apathetic toward politics, while Emma is enmeshed in them. Dexter is unhappy as well at the thought of turning forty in two weeks. They agree to meet later to view a house. In a rainstorm, riding her bike to the address, Emma is killed...
